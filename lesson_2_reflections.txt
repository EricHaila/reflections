What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden .git directory is created.  It establishes the intial git environment for tracking changes to files in the directory.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a file that contains information about what will go into the next commit. The working directory contains a single check out of one version of the project.
