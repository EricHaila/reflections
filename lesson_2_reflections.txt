What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new hidden .git directory is created.  It establishes the intial git environment for tracking changes to files in the directory.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a file that contains information about what will go into the next commit. The working directory contains a single check out of one version of the project.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add (git add) the files that are a part of the logical change.  Any other file(s) that is still in the working directory and not in the staging area will not be part of the modification.
